## üîß Core Features

### 1. PDF Merger
- Select multiple PDFs
- Drag-and-drop to reorder
- Merge into a single PDF
- Output location selection

### 2. PDF Splitter
- Select PDF
- Choose pages or range (e.g. 1‚Äì3, 5, 7‚Äì9)
- Output each selection as a separate PDF

### 3. PDF Compressor
- Accepts one or more PDF files
- Compress images and remove metadata
- Offer quality settings (Low / Medium / High)

### 4. PDF to JPG
- Select a PDF
- Export each page as separate high-quality JPG images
- Choose output folder

#### 4.1. User Interface & Experience
- **File Input**: A clear 'Select PDF' button and a drag-and-drop area.
- **Preview**: Display the name of the selected file. A thumbnail preview is a future enhancement.
- **Options**:
  - **Output Format**: A dropdown to select between JPG and PNG.
  - **Quality/Resolution**: A slider or dropdown for quality settings (e.g., Low - 150 DPI, Medium - 300 DPI, High - 600 DPI).
- **Action Button**: A 'Convert' button that becomes active only after a file is selected.
- **Progress**: A progress bar showing the conversion status, especially for multi-page documents.
- **Output**: A confirmation message with a button to open the output folder.

#### 4.2. Backend & Logic
- **IPC Channel**: An IPC channel (`convert-pdf-to-images`) will be established between the renderer and main processes.
- **Conversion Engine**: Use a robust library like **Ghostscript** for reliable, high-quality PDF-to-image conversion. This is preferred over pure JS solutions for performance and quality.
- **File Handling**: The main process will handle the file path, execute the conversion, and save the images to the user-specified directory.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback for common errors (e.g., corrupted PDF, Ghostscript not found, write permissions error).

### 5. JPG to PDF
- Select one or more JPG/PNG images
- Reorder before converting
- Merge into one PDF

### 6. PDF to Word
- Convert .pdf file into editable .docx format
- Use open-source libraries or external CLI/API tools
- Preserve text and simple formatting (bold, italics, headings)
